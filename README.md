The architecture of a utility-scale quantum computer remains unknown.
Many promising and competing platforms exist.
Building toward the utility-scale requires integrating these hardware capabilities with quantum error-correcting codes, fault-tolerant gate constructions, and supporting protocols such as magic state distillation and error decoding.
However, identifying effective combinations of these for a given platform is an arduous process that can take years, despite much of the exploration being rote. The discovery of novel or more efficient approaches can feed back to shape hardware specifications, influencing gate fidelities, connectivity, and control design.
This landscapepresents an opportunity for agentic workflows to accelerate the development of fault-tolerant architectures.
As a first demonstration, we propose an agentic workflow for identifying promising universal gate sets, establishing a foundation for agentic of next-generation quantum computing architectures.
